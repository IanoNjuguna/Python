## 1. [Hello World](Programming-In-Python\1-StackUp-Notes\Basics-1\Hello-World.py)

Traditionally when learning a new programming language, the first thing is to print out the ```Hello World``` statement.

### Why is this so?

    In my view, it is because:
        * the print function is a simple function from the Python standard library.
        * the print function is used to print any type of data or a result from any operation on the screen.
        * the print function is used for testing purposes.

 As with most things in programming, there are a myriad of possible answers to this query. Here are [some samples from the social media site, Quora](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-we-start-with-the-Hello-World?share=1)

## 2. Commenting

Commenting code is useful for documentation purposes and code readability.
In Python, comments are preceded by the ```#``` symbol.

## 3. Troubleshooting

Whenever an error message appears, use it to find the cause of the error and how it can be resolved.
To do this, you can Google, read docs or consult a fellow dev.
